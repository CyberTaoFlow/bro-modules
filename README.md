# bro-modules
This is a set of Bro scripts, organized into importable modules, that can be used to augment an existing Bro deployment.

# How to Use This Repo
The modules are organized into directory based on the organization or group they intend to support.  Within an organization/group directory, individual modules will be contained within their own directory.  This way, you only import modules you intend to use and don't bloat your Bro deployement with scripts that contain functionality you don't intend to utilize.
